# Milestone-I
Milestone I

Project Description

In particular, the project should show off your team’s ability to take a minimum of two data sets possessing different features and/or access methods and clean and manipulate them in order to extract a useful byproduct: something more than you could have gotten from either data set by itself. The cleaning and manipulation could involve filtering, format conversion, handling missing or noisy data, matching records from one data source with corresponding records in the other, and so on, and must make significant use of the programming tools and techniques covered in prior MADS courses.

❗ You are not expected to use advanced tools and techniques from courses that are not prerequisites of Milestone I (e.g., machine learning, causal inference, etc.), and in fact you are discouraged from doing so as neither your peers nor your instructors may be in a position to offer helpful advice.

There are several steps involved in the project:

Problem formulation
Team formation
Selection of data sources
Project proposal creation
Faculty mentor assigned (by the teaching team)
Peer feedback on project proposals
Final project report + code
Peer feedback on project reports


Dataset:

MIMIC-IV documentation
MIMIC-IV is a relational database containing real hospital stays for patients admitted to a tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA, USA. MIMIC-IV contains comprehensive information for each patient while they were in the hospital: laboratory measurements, medications administered, vital signs documented, and so on. The database is intended to support a wide variety of research in healthcare. MIMIC-IV builds upon the success of MIMIC-III, and incorporates numerous improvements over MIMIC-III.
MIMIC-IV is separated into “modules” to reflect the provenance of the data. There are currently five modules:
hosp - hospital level data for patients: labs, micro, and electronic medication administration
icu - ICU level data. These are the event tables, and are identical in structure to MIMIC-III (chartevents, etc)
ed - data from the emergency department
cxr - lookup tables and meta-data from MIMIC-CXR, allowing linking to MIMIC-IV
note - deidentified free-text clinical notes
