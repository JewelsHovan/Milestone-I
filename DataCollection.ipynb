      "   - **Data:** Not directly available from the provided sources. However, it is known that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a significant health issue globally, but specific prevalence percentages are not provided in the sources.\n",
      "   - **Note:** The WHO fact sheet provides mortality and impact data but does not specify the prevalence percentage of the global population affected by CVDs.\n",

      "   - **Data:** 4.9% of adults in the US have ever been diagnosed with coronary heart disease.\n",

      "5. **Global Mortality (Total Deaths per Year)**\n",
      "   - **Data:** An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths.\n",

      "   - **Data:** 702,880 deaths in the US were attributed to heart disease in 2022.\n",
