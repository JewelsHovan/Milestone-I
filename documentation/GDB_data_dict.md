### Data Dictionary

| Column Name                          | Data Type  | Description                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cause ID**                         | Integer    | A unique identifier for each cause or condition listed in the table. This acts as a primary key for the rows. |
| **Cause Hierarchy Level**            | Integer    | The hierarchical level of the cause in the classification structure. Higher numbers likely represent more granular categories or subcategories within broader causes. |
| **Cause Name**                       | String     | The name or description of the cause or condition associated with the `Cause ID`. This may include a general disease category, type of infection, or specific event leading to hospitalization or claim. |
| **ICD10**                            | String     | ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) codes associated with the cause or condition. This column may contain a list of codes separated by commas and includes the primary classification codes used in clinical diagnosis. |
| **ICD10 Used in Hospital/Claims Analyses** | String     | Specific ICD-10 codes that are relevant for analyses within hospital or claims data. These may be a subset or specialized grouping of the codes listed in the `ICD10` column. |
| **ICD9**                             | String     | ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision) codes that correspond to the cause or condition. Similar to `ICD10`, this column contains the codes that were used before the ICD-10 was widely adopted. |
| **ICD9 Used in Hospital/Claims Analyses** | String     | Specific ICD-9 codes used in hospital or claims analyses, providing a mapping of relevant ICD-9 codes that might have been used before ICD-10 implementation for certain conditions. |

### Notes:
- **Row 362**: The last row (row 362) appears to be a general note, indicating that the table provides a comprehensive mapping between ICD codes and their respective causes. It does not contain any data values but provides context for the table as a whole.
- **NaN Values**: Several entries in the columns (`ICD10`, `ICD10 Used in Hospital/Claims Analyses`, `ICD9`, and `ICD9 Used in Hospital/Claims Analyses`) contain `NaN` values. This indicates that no corresponding code exists or is not applicable for certain conditions.

### Additional Context
- **ICD Codes**: Both ICD-9 and ICD-10 are standard codes used globally for diagnosis and are used extensively in health record documentation, billing, and epidemiological research.
- **Hierarchical Level**: The `Cause Hierarchy Level` helps structure the data in a hierarchical form, likely from broader categories to more specific conditions.
