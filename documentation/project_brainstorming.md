## **Brainstorming Story Ideas**

### **Integrative Themes**

1. **Disparities in Disease Incidence and Outcomes**
   - **Idea:** Explore how certain diseases are more prevalent in Boston compared to state and national levels, and how this affects patient outcomes.
   - **Approach:** Use GBD data to identify diseases with higher incidence locally. Analyze MIMIC data to see how these diseases impact hospital resource utilization.

2. **The Role of Insurance in Healthcare Access**
   - **Idea:** Investigate whether insurance type influences the quality of care, LOS, and patient outcomes.
   - **Approach:** Compare patient outcomes in MIMIC data across different insurance categories. Correlate with CMS data to contextualize findings.

3. **Patient Flow Optimization**
   - **Idea:** Identify bottlenecks in patient flow from admission to discharge.
   - **Approach:** Utilize MIMIC data to map patient movements. Highlight stages with delays and propose strategies to improve efficiency.
